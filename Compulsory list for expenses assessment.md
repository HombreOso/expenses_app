Compulsory list for expenses
================================

Static monthly expenses such as rent, travel expenses, loan payments, family assistance, gym and other regular payments are subtracted from the salary.

There should be an option to enter these expenses on a separate screen when setting up the app:

E.G.:

- Salary net

- List of regular expenses: Here we need to opt for a dynamic list of cards that contain TextInput widgets.


The user should be able to name each of the regular expenses and enter the corresponding static amount.
Dynamic (controllable) expenses should also be entered when the app is launched for a first time. For each dynamic expense category, it should be possible to enter a specific amount (optionally: a specific percentage of the available amount remaining after regular payments are subtracted).

There should be a way to change the above settings from the menu in the AppBar.

The chart on the main page should show the amount spent and the amount remaining for each category of dynamic spending.

The amount available per category divided by the number of days left in the month should also be displayed.

The total number of dynamic spend categories should not exceed seven.

It should be possible to edit expenses (by clicking on a ListTile). E.g. if they were created incorrectly.

Monitoring period: from the 1st day of the current month to the last day of the month.

The data should be collected in a database. Which database should be used: a local NoSQL or SQL database or a cloud database like Firebase.
